The goal is to make the structure clearer and more organized.</li>\n<li><strong>Task 1</strong> – This repository contains my daily notes. Your job is to read all the notes and assist in reorganizing them.</li>\n<li><strong>Task 2</strong> – Read all the notes and rewrite them using the same structure: <code>Abstract</code>, <code>Content</code>, <code>Recap</code>, and <code>Reference</code>. Also check for spelling errors and improve the content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Task-1-Results\">Task 1 Results</h2>\n<p>Maybe it’s my fault. Maybe my instructions weren’t clear enough. Codex created a <code>README.md</code> file containing a table of contents (TOC) like this. It looked fine, but I wanted it to read all the notes and help reorganize them, not just create a TOC.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1YcGqxQee.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Task-2-Results\">Task 2 Results</h2>\n<p>I don’t know why, but Codex did follow my instructions to rewrite the notes… however, it almost removed all of the content, leaving only a very short abstract (1–2 lines). The quality of the rewritten content was also poor.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryity9eXgg.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n","_path":"reflection_codex/","_link":"https://hsiangjenli.github.io/blog/reflection_codex/","_id":"cmfj240wv000wpw2bcniwgrf8"}}
