These methodologies aim to help AI Agents plan before coding. However, they often store the large amount of planning documents directly in the project repo. Although they look detailed, these documents become a burden when requirements keep changing. When requirements change, it’s hard to verify whether the AI Agent has correctly read and updated the relevant documents, and difficult to audit and track changes, especially in collaborative environments or when maintaining legacy projects.</p>","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"ai","_id":"cmihvk767002jn1299jnrh6bs"},{"name":"bdd","_id":"cmihvk768002on1298bdc4kvn"},{"name":"sdd","_id":"cmihvk769002un129bsav74lo"},{"name":"tdd","_id":"cmihvk76a0030n129bdzk77lc"}],"lang":"en","slug":"note-github-issue-ai-agent-bdd-sdd-tdd.en","_path":"/note-github-issue-ai-agent-bdd-sdd-tdd.en/","_link":"https://hsiangjenli.github.io/blog//note-github-issue-ai-agent-bdd-sdd-tdd.en/","_id":"cmihvk75q000nn129dfqm3x8l","source_sha":"9227cf5f8f965d785ac4f3824b2f2bddad829003320e101a8c2e193ce3c0c1b1","origin_lang":"zh-TW","author":["Hsiang-Jen Li"," & GitHub Copilot"],"toc":true},{"title":"[tutorial] Introduction to sigstore's model signing tool","date":"2025-11-05T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2025-11-05T16:00:00.000Z","description":"<blockquote>\n<p>Note: This page is an AI-generated (gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07) translation from Traditional Chinese and may contain minor inaccuracies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>📌 Introduction</h1>\n<p>Introducing Sigstore’s model signing tool and describing how its three-layer structure (Sigstore Bundle, DSSE Envelope, In‑Toto Statement) provides integrity, authenticity, and transparency for machine learning model signing and verification.
