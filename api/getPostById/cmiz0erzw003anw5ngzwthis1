The goal is to make the structure more clear and organized.</li>\n<li><strong>Task 1</strong> – This repo contains my daily notes. Your job is to read all the notes and help reorganize them.</li>\n<li><strong>Task 2</strong> – Read all the notes and rewrite them using the same structure: <code>Abstract</code>, <code>Content</code>, <code>Recap</code>, and <code>Reference</code>. Also, check for spelling errors and improve the content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Task-1-Result\">Task 1 Result</h2>\n<p>Maybe it’s my fault. Maybe my instruction was not clear. Codex created a <code>README.md</code> file with a table of contents (TOC) like this. It looks okay, but I wanted it to read all notes and help reorganize them, not just create a TOC.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1YcGqxQee.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Task-2-Result\">Task 2 Result</h2>\n<p>I don’t know why, but Codex followed my instruction to rewrite the notes… However, it removed almost all content and only kept a very short abstract (1–2 lines).<br>\nThe quality of the rewritten content is also very bad.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryity9eXgg.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n","_path":"/reflection-first-experience-with-codex.en/","_link":"https://hsiangjenli.github.io/blog/reflection-first-experience-with-codex.en/","_id":"cmiz0erzw003anw5ngzwthis1"}}
