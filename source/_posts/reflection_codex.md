# ðŸ“Œ Introduction

In short, Codex didnâ€™t perform well at all.

# ðŸš€ Quick Start

- **Background** - This repo is a refactor of my 30 days of daily notes. The goal is to make the structure more clear and organized.
- **Task 1** â€“ This repo contains my daily notes. Your job is to read all the notes and help reorganize them.
- **Task 2** â€“ Read all the notes and rewrite them using the same structure: `Abstract`, `Content`, `Recap`, and `Reference`. Also, check for spelling errors and improve the content.

## Task 1 Result

Maybe it's my fault. Maybe my instruction was not clear. Codex created a `README.md` file with a table of contents (TOC) like this. It looks okay, but I wanted it to read all notes and help reorganize them, not just create a TOC.

## Task 2 Result

I don't know why, but Codex followed my instruction to rewrite the notes... However, it removed almost all content and only kept a very short abstract (1â€“2 lines).
The quality of the rewritten content is also very bad.
