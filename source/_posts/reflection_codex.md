# ðŸ“Œ Introduction

In short, Codex's performance was far from ideal.

# ðŸš€ Quick Start

- **Background** - This repository is a refactor of my 30 days of daily notes. The goal is to make the structure clearer and more organized.
- **Task 1** â€“ This repository contains my daily notes. Your job is to read all the notes and assist in reorganizing them.
- **Task 2** â€“ Read all the notes and rewrite them using the same structure: `Abstract`, `Content`, `Recap`, and `Reference`. Also check for spelling errors and improve the content.

## Task 1 Results

Maybe it's my fault. Maybe my instructions weren't clear enough. Codex created a `README.md` file containing a table of contents (TOC) like this. It looked fine, but I wanted it to read all the notes and help reorganize them, not just create a TOC.

## Task 2 Results

I don't know why, but Codex did follow my instructions to rewrite the notes... however, it almost removed all of the content, leaving only a very short abstract (1â€“2 lines). The quality of the rewritten content was also poor.
