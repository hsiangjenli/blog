# 📌 Introduction

While installing the Docker Model Plugin on Ubuntu 24.04, I ran into an issue where apt couldn’t locate the package. It turned out that the Docker repository was pointing to the wrong release (focal instead of noble).

When I following the tuorial from [How to Run Docker Model Runner on Ubuntu 24.04](https://mrcloudbook.com/how-to-run-docker-model-runner-on-ubuntu-24-04/). I found an issue that apt install cannot find docker-model-plugin. The solution is 

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
  ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) \
    signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) stable" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

# 🔁 Recap

- The error occurred because the Docker APT repository was pointing to the wrong release (focal instead of noble)
- Fixing the issue required adding the correct Docker GPG key and configuring the proper repository for Ubuntu 24.04
- After updating the APT sources, the docker-model-plugin package became available for installation
