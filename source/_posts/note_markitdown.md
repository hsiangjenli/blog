  A Python API to retrieve transcripts of specified YouTube videos.

## SpeechRecognition
- https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/tree/master
  Supports speech-to-text engines such as Google Cloud Speech API, Wit.ai, Whisper, etc.

## markdownify

## puremagic
- https://github.com/cdgriffith/puremagic/tree/master
- **Puremagic is a file type detection tool** that can identify the type of an input file without relying on file extensions. Since extensions can be easily changed, relying on them alone to identify file types can be risky. The module defines a set of rules to read file contents and determine their type.

```python
# puremagic/magic_data.json
{
  "extension_only": [
    ["", 0, ".txt", "text/plain", "Text File"],
    ["", 0, ".log", "text/plain", "Logger File"],
    ["", 0, ".yaml", "application/x-yaml", "YAML File"],
    ["", 0, ".yml", "application/x-yaml", "YAML File"],
    ["", 0, ".toml", "application/toml", "TOML File"],
    ["", 0, ".py", "text/x-python", "Python File"],
    ["", 0, ".pyc", "application/x-python", "Python Complied File"],
    ["", 0, ".pyd", "application/x-python", "Python Complied File"],
    ["", 0, ".python_history", "text/plain", "Python History File"],
    ["", 0, ".bat", "application/x-script", "Windows BAT file"],
    ["", 0, ".gitconfig", "text/plain", "Git Ignore File"],
...
