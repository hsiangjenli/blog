### Set Up Repo
To ensure your images are accessible, set your repo to ***public***.

## VScode Extension

1. Install **PicGo** extension in VScode
1. Set **`Pic Bed: Current`** to **github**
1. Set **`Pic Bed > Github: Repo`** to your previously created public repo. Format is `{username}/{repo_name}`
1. Set **`Pic Bed: Uploader`** to **github**
1. Set **`Pic Bed > Github: Branch`** to the branch of your public repo
1. Set **`Pic Bed > Github: Path`** (Optional). If you want to store images in specific folder (e.g. `images`). Make sure to include a trailing slash (`/`), otherwise, it will be used as a prefix for image names
1. Set **`Pic Bed > Github: Token`** to the Github token you created earlier
