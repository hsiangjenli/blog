### Configure the repository
Set the repository to ***public*** to ensure your images can be accessed.

## VSCode Extension

1. Install the **PicGo** extension in VSCode
1. Set **`Pic Bed: Current`** to **github**
1. Set **`Pic Bed > Github: Repo`** to the public repository you created. Format: `{username}/{repo_name}`
1. Set **`Pic Bed: Uploader`** to **github**
1. Set **`Pic Bed > Github: Branch`** to the branch of your public repository
1. Configure **`Pic Bed > Github: Path`** (optional). If you want images stored in a specific folder (e.g., `images`), make sure to include a trailing slash (`/`); otherwise the value will be treated as a prefix of the image name.
1. Set **`Pic Bed > Github: Token`** to the GitHub token you created earlier

### Troubleshooting

If you see the following error, it means `xclip` is not installed on your system:

```shell
PicGo: xclip not found! Please install xclip before run picgo.
```
To fix this, install `xclip` using the following command:

```shell
sudo apt install xclip
```
