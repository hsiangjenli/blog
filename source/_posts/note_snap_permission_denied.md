# üß≠ Troubleshooting framework

## Problem

```
cannot fstatat canonical snap directory: Permission denied
```

## Root cause analysis

In general, there are two common causes for this issue:

1. The system is installed on an NTFS partition.
1. The home directory is symlinked to a non-standard location.

### Check filesystem type

```shell
df -T /

Filesystem     Type 1K-blocks     Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/nvme0n1p4 ext4 669754920 44435324 591224492   7% /
```

The system is installed on an ext4 partition


### Check symlinks

```shell
ls -l /home/hsiangjenli/Documents/github

drwxrwxr-x 10 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  ‰∏Ä  27 17:05 blog
drwxrwxr-x 11 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  ‰∏â  28 17:03 default-of-credit-card-clients-mlops
drwxrwxr-x  8 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  ‰∏Ä  29 16:40 hsiangjenli.github.io
drwxrwxr-x  5 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  ‰∏â  27 14:28 java-from-python
drwxrwxr-x  4 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  ‰∏Ä  29 17:19 pic-bed
drwxrwxr-x 11 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  ‰∫å  16 08:44 python-package-template
drwxrwxr-x  6 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  ‰∏Ä  27 17:25 star-to-review
```

These folders are not symlinks

## Why this happened

I don't know ...

## Solution

Surprisingly, running the following command resolved the issue:

```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure apparmor
```
Enter the target directory you want to use
