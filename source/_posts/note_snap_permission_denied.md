# 📚 Prerequisite

- AppArmor
- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- fstatat
- snap

Below are some key concepts mentioned in this article:

| Term | 中文說明 | English Description |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| **AppArmor** | Ubuntu 的一種安全模組，用來限制應用程式能存取的資源，例如檔案、網路。 | A security module in Ubuntu that restricts what resources an application can access. |
| **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** | 一種常見的用戶驗證協定，常用於企業環境集中管理帳號。 | A common user authentication protocol used for centralized account management, especially in enterprise environments. |
| **fstatat** | 一個 Linux 系統呼叫，用來查詢檔案資訊。這個錯誤就是因為它失敗了。 | A Linux system call used to get information about files. The error occurs when this call fails. |
| **Snap** | Ubuntu 推出的套件系統，讓應用程式更容易安裝、升級與隔離管理。 | A packaging system by Ubuntu that makes applications easy to install, update, and sandbox. |

- **Non-standard home directory**: The user’s home directory is located outside the default `/home/username` path, often on a different drive or mount point
- **Home directory is symlinked**: The home directory appears to be in `/home/username`, but it’s actually a symbolic link pointing to another location

# 🧭 Problem-solving Framework

## Problem

```
cannot fstatat canonical snap directory: Permission denied
```

## Root Cause Analysis

In general, there are two common causes for this issue:

1. The system is installed on an NTFS partition.
1. The home directory is symlinked to a non-standard location.

### Check Filesystem Type

```shell
df -T /

Filesystem     Type 1K-blocks     Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/nvme0n1p4 ext4 669754920 44435324 591224492   7% /
```

The system is installed on an ext4 partition


### Check for Symlinks

```shell
ls -l /home/hsiangjenli/Documents/github

drwxrwxr-x 10 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  一  27 17:05 blog
drwxrwxr-x 11 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  三  28 17:03 default-of-credit-card-clients-mlops
drwxrwxr-x  8 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  一  29 16:40 hsiangjenli.github.io
drwxrwxr-x  5 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  三  27 14:28 java-from-python
drwxrwxr-x  4 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  一  29 17:19 pic-bed
drwxrwxr-x 11 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  二  16 08:44 python-package-template
drwxrwxr-x  6 hsiangjenli hsiangjenli 4096  一  27 17:25 star-to-review
```

None of the folders are symbolic links

## Why This Happens

I don't know ...

## Solution

Surprisingly, running the following command solved the issue:

```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure apparmor
```
Enter the destination directory that you want to use
