##  Why Use TypedDict?

<!-- more -->

In general, we use **dataclasses** and **Pydantic** to store data. However, using **dictionaries** to store complex data is often an easier approach. Nevertheless, without predefined fields, it becomes difficult for later developers to maintain the code effectively. Using `TypedDict` allows the IDE to provide developers with suggestions, enhancing their development efficiency. However, TypedDict has limitations, such as the inability to enforce strict type checking.

```python
from typing import TypedDict
import datetime


class News(TypedDict):
    title: str 
    create_date: datetime.datetime
    content: str
```
