# 🚀 Quick Start
To install the development version from GitHub using pip, run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/username/repository.git@devel
```

# 🔁 Summary
- You can use pip to install a specific branch from GitHub.
- The 'devel' branch typically contains unstable development versions.
- To install, use the command format: `pip install git+{repo_url}@{branch_name}`.
- Replace `{repo_url}` with your repository URL and `{branch_name}` with 'devel'.
- Make sure pip is installed to use this command.
