"**OCI Artifact**" stands for "**Open Container Initiative Artifact**." It is a unified format that can be used to store anything â€” whether Docker images, Helm charts, WASM modules, machine learning models, SBOMs, policies, or scan reports.

Most importantly, any item that follows the OCI format can be uploaded to or downloaded from registries (for example Harbor, DockerHub, Artifact Hub).

- **Manifest** â€“ Describes an artifact (e.g., Docker image, Helm chart) and references blobs.
- **Blobs** â€“ The actual content, such as .tar.gz, binaries, or configuration files used by the artifact.
