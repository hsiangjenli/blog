# ðŸ“Œ What is an OCI Artifact?

The full name of **OCI Artifact** is **Open Container Initiative Artifact**. It is a unified format that can be used to store anything â€” whether it's a Docker image, Helm chart, WASM module, ML model, SBOM, policy, or scan report.

Most importantly, anything that follows the OCI format can be uploaded to or downloaded from a registry (e.g., Harbor, DockerHub, Artifact Hub).
