# ðŸ“Œ What is an OCI Artifact?

"**OCI Artifact**" stands for "**Open Container Initiative Artifact**." It is a unified format that can be used to store anything â€” whether Docker images, Helm charts, WASM modules, machine learning models, SBOMs, policies, or scan reports.

Most importantly, any item that follows the OCI format can be uploaded to or downloaded from registries (for example Harbor, DockerHub, Artifact Hub).

# ðŸš€ OCI Artifact Structure

- **Tag** â€“ A human-readable name (for example `nginx:1.0`) that points to a manifest or index. A tag is a version label.
- **Index** â€“ A list of manifests, commonly used for multi-platform artifacts.
- **Manifest** â€“ Describes an artifact (e.g., Docker image, Helm chart) and references blobs.
- **Blobs** â€“ The actual content, such as .tar.gz, binaries, or configuration files used by the artifact.
